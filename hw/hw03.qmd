## Exercise 1

Let $Y_1, \ldots Y_n | \theta$ be an i.i.d. random sample from a population with pdf $p(y|\theta)$ where 

$$
p(y|\theta) = \frac{2}{\Gamma(a)} \theta^{2a} y^{2a -1} e^{-\theta^2 y^2}
$$

and $y > 0$, $\theta > 0$, $a > 0$.

For this density, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
E~Y|\theta &= \frac{\Gamma(a + \frac{1}{2})}{\theta \Gamma(a)}\\
E~Y^2|\theta &= \frac{a}{\theta^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Call this density $g^2$ such that $Y_1, \ldots Y_n | \theta \sim g^2(a, \theta)$.

a. Find the joint pdf of $Y_1, \ldots Y_n | \theta$ and simplify as much as possible.

b. Suppose $a$ is known but $\theta$ is unknown. Identify a simple conjugate class of priors for $\theta$. For any arbitrary member of the class, identify the posterior density $p(\theta | y_1, \ldots y_n)$.

c. Obtain a formula for $E~ \theta | Y_1, \ldots Y_n$ and $Var~\theta | Y_1, \ldots Y_n$ when the prior is in the conjugate class.

## Exercise 2

Physicists studying a radioactive substance measure the times at which the substance emits a particle. They will record $n+1$ emissions and set $Y_1$ to be the time elapsed between the first and second emission, $Y_2$ to be the time elapsed between the second and third emission and so on. They will model the data as $Y_1, \ldots Y_n | \theta \sim \text{i.i.d. } \text{exponential}(\theta)$. The pdf of the exponential($\theta$) distribution is 

$$
p(y |\theta) = \theta e^{-\theta y} \ \text{ for } \ y>0, \ \theta>0.
$$

For this distribution, $E[Y|\theta] = \frac{1}{\theta}$.

(a). Write out the corresponding joint density $p(y_1, \ldots, y_n | \theta)$ and simplify as much as possible. Justify each step of your calculation.

(b). Compute the maximum likelihood estimate $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}$, i.e. the value $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}$ that maximizes $p(y_1,\ldots y_n | \theta)$. Hint: it's easier to work with the log-likelihood.

(c). Choose a prior $p(\theta)$ that is conjugate to the likelihood. Hint: look at kernels of densities on the distribution sheet. Write out the formula for $p(\theta | y_1, \ldots y_n)$, up to a proportionality in $\theta$, and simplify as much as possible. From this, identify explicitly the posterior distribution of $\theta$ (i.e., write "the posterior is a blank distribution with parameter(s) blank)".

(d). Obtain the formula for $E[\theta | y_1, \ldots y_n]$ as a function of $a, b, n$ and $y_1, \ldots y_n$, and try to write this as a function of the estimator $\hat{\theta}$ you found in part (b). What does $E[\theta | y_1,\ldots,y_n]$ get close to as $n$ increases?

(e). Assume you observe $(y_1, \ldots, y_5) = (0.13, 0.31, 0.15, 0.12, 0.29)$ and let $\theta \sim \text{gamma}(1, 1)$. Report a 95\% posterior confidence interval for $\theta$.

## Exercise 3

Suppose $Y|\theta \sim \text{binary}(\theta)$ and we believe $\theta \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1)$ describes our uninformed prior beliefs about $\theta$. However, we are really interested in the log-odds $\gamma = f(\theta) = \log \frac{\theta}{1 - \theta}$.

a. Find the prior distribution for $\gamma$ induced by our prior on $\theta$. Is the prior informative about $\gamma$? Verify $p(\gamma)$ using Monte Carlo sampling (i.e. sampling from $p(\theta)$) and then plotting the empirical density of the transformed samples along with the closed-form solution.

b. **In general**, is the mean of the transform the same as the transform of the mean? In other words, is $E f(\theta) = f(E[\theta])$? Why or why not?

c. Assume some data come in and $\sum y_i = 7$ out of $n = 10$ trials. Report the posterior mean and 95% posterior confidence interval for $\gamma$. Is the transform of the quantile the quantile of the transform? Why or why not?
